This directory structure is suitable for a simple PHP project with a few pages. The includes/ directory contains files that are included in multiple pages, such as a header and footer. The css/, js/, and img/ directories contain static assets used in the pages. The root directory contains the PHP files for each page. The index.php file is the home page of the website, and the about.php and contact.php files are additional pages.

In this structure, each directory contains related SASS partials that are used to build the final CSS stylesheet. Here's a brief explanation of each directory:

base/: Contains SASS partials for basic styles, such as a CSS reset, typography, and other common styles.

components/: Contains SASS partials for reusable components, such as buttons, forms, and other UI elements.

layout/: Contains SASS partials for page layout, such as the header and footer.

pages/: Contains SASS partials for specific page styles, such as the home page, about page, etc.

themes/: Contains SASS partials for different themes or styles, such as a dark theme.

utils/: Contains SASS partials for utility classes, such as variables, mixins, and other helper styles.

main.scss: The main SASS file that imports all the partials and compiles them into a single CSS stylesheet.

This structure provides a modular and organized approach to writing SASS stylesheets, which can make it easier to manage and maintain large projects. As with any directory structure, you can customize it to fit your specific needs and preferences.
